In his work on Generative Online Adversarial Training (GOAT), he combines a pretrained generative model with adversarial training to sample realistic but challenging partner policies for a cooperative agent. GOAT dynamically searches the generative model's latent space for coordination strategies where the learning agent underperforms, thereby exposing the cooperator to diverse interaction scenarios and improving generalization to novel human behaviors. This framework yields state-of-the-art performance on Overcooked benchmarks and demonstrates how adversarial training can be adapted to cooperative human-AI settings."

His group designs computational models and algorithms to decode how single-trial neural population activity relates to movements, decisions and learning. Their research uses probabilistic latent variable models and deep neural networks to analyze large-scale neural recordings and studies how neural populations change during learning, how decisions are formed and executed, and how brain-computer interfaces can provide insight into neural computation. Golub's postdoctoral work at Stanford employed deep-learning techniques to understand population-level neural computations underlying perceptual decision making. He collaborates widely with experimental groups to develop new analysis methods that bridge systems neuroscience and AI."

In the FlowRing project, he designed a ring-form factor device that supports dual-mode interaction: users can perform five subtle microgestures for on-the-go input and use the ring as a 2D continuous input device on surfaces. A gating classifier switches between gesture and continuous-tracking modes, and a convolutional neural network combined with an LSTM classifies microgestures using data from a contact microphone, optical-flow sensor and six-degree-of-freedom inertial measurement unit. The device achieves 93.6 % microgesture recognition across sessions (85.2 % on unseen users) and aims to bridge high-throughput stationary input with subtle mobile interactions for XR."

In another project he transmits random white-noise signals and subtracts them to detect tiny chest movements, enabling non-contact monitoring of infant breathing using a microphone array. His work enables low-cost, contact-free health sensing via acoustics and machine learning."

First, she investigates reliability, exploring whether models can recognize when they lack knowledge and abstain, especially for high-stakes applications such as medical decision support. Second, she studies evaluation, working to identify biases in model assessments and to align evaluations with human preferences, particularly for multimodal tasks. Third, she examines alignment, developing data-centric approaches to better align large models with limited high-quality data and to enable self-improvement."

She aims to align robotic assistance with users' goals by learning human preferences, investigating intrinsic motivation objectives for assistive agents and developing shared autonomy systems that balance robot assistance with user control. Her first paper analyzes how robot autonomy affects user agency and was accepted to RO-MAN 2025, and she is examining the disempowerment that can occur when assistance is offered in multi-agent scenarios. Earlier, Yang's undergraduate research at the University of Minnesota focused on representing and inferring social preferences in multi-agent environments and planning for non-playable characters in games. Her overarching goal is to design assistive robots that are aligned with human values and that empower users."

As co-lead author of a Nature paper, she helped develop a method for long-range, single-molecule protein sequencing using nanopore technology. The approach pushes proteins through a nanopore sensor multiple times to reduce noise and obtain accurate sequencing readouts. Kontogiorgos-Heintz focuses on interpreting nanopore signals to deduce amino acid sequences at the single-molecule level, enabling detection of post-translational modifications and advancing proteomics. Her work has been recognized at the UW Research Showcase, highlighting the commercial potential of single-molecule protein sequencing."

      "about": "Kunal Jha's doctoral work seeks to build agents that can learn and interact like humans. Drawing on cognitive science, philosophy, economics and physics, he designs algorithms for social learning-where agents acquire skills or causal models by observing others-and theory-of-mind, allowing agents to reason about hidden mental states. His research uses deep and multi-agent reinforcement learning, energy-based and probabilistic causal models, evolutionary algorithms and game theory to foster embodied cognition. Jha's 'Cross-Environment Cooperation' framework trains agents across a distribution of environments to develop general cooperative norms and achieve zero-shot coordination with new partners, demonstrating how diverse training encourages robust cooperation."

His research targets the challenges of data-centric AI: he studies how to continuously evaluate multimodal models beyond static benchmarks, how to better represent and utilize diverse training data, and how to synthesize or collect new datasets that address failure modes of large language and vision models By developing dynamic evaluation frameworks and new data representations, Zhang aims to ensure that foundation models remain robust as they are deployed in the wild. He also explores techniques for automated data augmentation and synthesis to improve generalization across modalities, with the goal of building more adaptive and trustworthy AI systems."

She develops latent-based models to learn the underlying dynamics of neural activity recorded from multiple brain areas while animals perform memory-guided decision-making tasks. Liu co-authored the multi-region latent factor analysis via dynamical systems (MR-LFADS) technique, which uses deep learning to decode communication between brain regions when some areas cannot be recorded, enabling prediction of how perturbing one region affects others. Her work aims to reveal how neural circuits communicate during complex cognitive tasks and to improve analysis of large-scale electrophysiological data."

      "about": "Henry Wong is a Ph.D. student co-advised by Jeff Nivala and Yoshi Kohno. His research spans cyber security and molecular informatics: he develops adversarial techniques for attacking communication protocols and studies how to secure emerging molecular information systems. His background includes an M.S. and B.S. in computer science from Missouri University of Science and Technology, where his thesis demonstrated a man-in-the-middle attack on the MQTT protocol using a custom parser and a BERT-based adversarial model that generated malicious messages able to evade multiple anomaly-detection defenses. At the University of Washington, Wong applies similar adversarial and AI techniques to secure DNA-based data storage and computing platforms, and he works at Sandia National Laboratories on cyber security and AI research."

In the InvestESG project she helped develop a multi-agent reinforcement-learning benchmark that models corporate climate investment decisions and ESG disclosure mandates as an intertemporal social dilemma, showing how agents balance short-term profits against long-term climate benefits. She also contributed to the CASHER pipeline, which scales robot-learning data collection by combining real-to-sim-to-real transfer, digital twins and reinforcement learning bootstrapped with human demonstrations. Her work demonstrates how RL and robotics can be harnessed for climate action and scalable learning systems."

This work also identified challenges users face when maintaining multiple coordinated views, highlighting the need for software support to preserve consistency across charts Lamkin's research uses empirical studies to inform the design of programming environments for data visualization."

His research investigates equality saturation (EqSat), a program optimization technique that represents many equivalent program rewrites simultaneously. He studies theoretical properties such as termination, develops egglog to integrate EqSat with the Datalog query language, and improves pattern-matching algorithms to make equality saturation faster and more expressive Zhang applies these techniques to domains like computational fabrication and database query optimization, demonstrating how programming-language theory can benefit data management. By unifying declarative logic programming with equality saturation, his work aims to provide a general framework for reasoning about and optimizing complex computations."

He is a co-founder of Snorkel, which pioneered the concept of weak supervision, allowing users to label, augment and structure training datasets by writing labeling functions that encode heuristics, knowledge bases or other models. By replacing manual hand-labeling with programmatic labeling and aggregation, weak supervision drastically reduces the time required to build high-quality training sets and opens new systems, algorithmic and theoretical challenges. Ratner's work has been applied to tasks ranging from chemical reaction extraction to medical imaging and natural language processing, demonstrating how programmatic labeling can accelerate the development of AI applications."

He studies reinforced fine-tuning of large language models, designing self-play RL frameworks to make language models safer and more aligned; he created datasets such as BeaverTails for safety alignment and developed the Safe RLHF algorithm to incorporate human feedback in a principled way. Liu also explores multi-agent reinforcement learning for perception and control, introducing the Active3DPose scheme, which uses Shapley-value-inspired rewards and multi-agent RL to enable proactive multi-camera collaboration for 3D human pose estimation. He co-developed the MATE (Multi-Agent Tracking Environment) benchmark for target coverage control and contributed to open-sourcing the Baichuan2 large language model."

She co-authored work on gendered mental health stigma in masked language models, which showed that pre-trained language models reflect societal biases by associating mental health conditions more often with women. Her research interests include developing methods to detect and mitigate such biases in NLP systems. Because limited official information is available about her research, this summary draws primarily from the gendered stigma project and her specialization in NLP."

      "about": "As a PhD student in the Ubicomp Lab, Alvin Cao explores how everyday devices can be used for telehealth. In the EarSteth project he co-authored, Cao and collaborators wire out the inner, ear-facing microphone of consumer active-noise-cancelling earbuds and headphones to record cardiac acoustics without specialized hardware. They train an autoencoder using digital stethoscope data to reconstruct heart sounds and evaluate the system on 23 users; the study shows that over-ear headphones yield higher fidelity heart-sound reconstruction, performance depends on device fit and user activity, and murmurs can be detected remotely. This work demonstrates the potential of consumer hearables for remote auscultation and highlights design considerations for telehealth sensing."

      "about": "Daphne Chen is a Ph.D. student jointly affiliated with the Human-Centered Robotics Lab and the WEIRD Lab. The HCR lab notes that she started in 2023 and her research interests include robot learning and preference learning, building on master's work at Carnegie Mellon University and a bachelor's from Georgia Tech. Her recent work on learning human preferences for personalized assistance proposes a few-shot method that trains a sequential model to predict the next action in cooking tasks using synthetic data and then fine-tunes it on demonstrations from individual users, enabling assistive agents to provide guidance aligned with each person's temporal preferences with minimal data. She evaluates the approach through user studies, highlighting that assistive agents must learn user preferences quickly and data-efficiently. Chen's broader goal is to enable real-world robots to personalize their behavior to different users by combining machine learning with insights from human-computer interaction and preference modeling."
